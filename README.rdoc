Some example code of how to add and retrieve from the database:


<p>nate = Student.new(name: "Nate", age: 26)</p>

nate.save

cpp = Course.new(name: "C++")

cpp.save

nate.courses.push(cpp)


nate.courses would return a collection of all the courses that have been added.

To see how this relationship was created view the db migration files as well as the course.rb and student.rb files.
